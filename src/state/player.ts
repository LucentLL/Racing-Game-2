 * H6: this is INTENTIONALLY simpler than the monolith's player state
 * (which carries 40+ fields for tire slip, gear, RPM, engine load,
 * fuel, etc., in L17648-17985). The fields here are the minimum to
 * drive a triangle around an empty plane — px/py position, pAngle
 * heading, pSpeed scalar speed. Subsequent H commits grow this struct
 * as physics/tire/steering bodies port and start needing real state.
 *
 * The richer state lives on a separate type in src/physics/ when those
 * ports land; this file stays the pose-only contract that render and
 * camera read from.
